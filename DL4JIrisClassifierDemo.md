# Using Deeplearning4J in Android Applications

## DL4JIrisClassifierDemo
The example application trains a small neural network on the device using Andersonâ€™s Iris data set for iris flower type classification. The application has a simple UI to take measurements of petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width from the user and it returns the probability that the measured iris belongs to one of three types (Iris serosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). A data set includes 150 measurement values (50 for each iris type) and training the model takes anywhere from 5-20 seconds, depending on the device.
